## Case Study: Comprehensive Analysis of Dementia-Associated Protein Pathways Using ProteoNexus

To demonstrate the analytical capabilities and biological insights afforded by ProteoNexus, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of dementia, a complex neurodegenerative disorder with multifactorial etiology. This case study illustrates how the platform enables systematic exploration of protein-mediated pathways linking diverse risk factors to disease outcomes.

### Overview of Global Search Results

A global query for "dementia" within the ProteoNexus database yielded 2,743 statistically significant pathway triplets, revealing the extensive molecular landscape underlying this disease. These pathways were distributed across three major categories: 1,872 Measurement-to-Protein-to-Disease (M-P-D) associations, 849 Environment-to-Protein-to-Disease (E-P-D) associations, and 22 Genotype-to-Protein-to-Disease (G-P-D) associations. This comprehensive search identified 285 unique plasma proteins serving as molecular mediators between various risk factors and dementia outcomes.

The frequency analysis of protein mediators across all pathway categories revealed a set of hub proteins that appear repeatedly in dementia-associated pathways. The most prominent mediators included GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15), VGF (VGF neurosecretory protein), NEFL (neurofilament light chain), BCAN (brevican), TNFRSF10B (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10B), and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein). These proteins represent diverse biological functions ranging from metabolic regulation to neuronal structure and inflammatory signaling, reflecting the multisystem nature of dementia pathogenesis.

### Measurement-to-Protein-to-Dementia Pathways

The analysis of M-P-D pathways revealed a striking predominance of anthropometric measurements as risk factors for dementia. Among the 23 baseline measurements showing significant associations with dementia through protein mediation, 21 were anthropometric traits, while psychosocial factors and other measurements each contributed only one trait. This distribution underscores the critical role of body composition and physical function in dementia risk.

The most robust associations were observed for measures of muscle strength and body composition. Hand grip strength, measured separately for left and right hands, showed associations with dementia through 139 and 119 proteins respectively. Similarly, measures of central adiposity, including waist-hip ratio (128 proteins) and waist circumference (3 proteins), demonstrated extensive protein-mediated connections to dementia risk. Whole body fat mass and trunk fat mass were each linked to dementia through 125 and 116 proteins respectively, while measures of muscle mass, such as right arm fat-free mass, showed mediation through 117 proteins. These findings suggest that the relationship between physical phenotype and cognitive decline is mediated by a complex network of molecular pathways rather than single mechanisms.

Sex-stratified analyses revealed both shared and distinct protein mediation patterns between males and females. A core set of seven proteins—BCAN, EDA2R, GDF15, GFAP, NEFL, TNFRSF10B, and VGF—demonstrated significant mediation effects across the whole cohort as well as in sex-specific analyses. However, important sex-specific pathways were also identified. For instance, the pathway linking trunk fat percentage to dementia through VGF protein mediation was statistically significant only in males, with an indirect effect of -0.00414 (SE = 0.00105, adjusted p-value = 0.028), while no significant effects were observed in females or the combined cohort. Conversely, the mediation of waist circumference effects on dementia through GDF15, BCAN, and MENT proteins was significant exclusively in females, with no corresponding signals in males or the combined analysis. These sex-specific differences in protein mediation pathways suggest that the molecular mechanisms linking body composition to cognitive decline may differ fundamentally between males and females, with implications for personalized risk assessment and intervention strategies.

### Environment-to-Protein-to-Dementia Pathways

Environmental and lifestyle factors demonstrated extensive connections to dementia risk through protein mediation, with four major exposure categories identified. Healthy lifestyle factors contributed four traits, while residential air pollution contributed three traits. Greenspace and coastal proximity, along with sociodemographic factors, each contributed two traits to the overall pathway landscape.

The analysis revealed that sociodemographic factors exerted the broadest influence on dementia risk at the molecular level. Employment status was associated with dementia through 158 distinct protein mediators, while the Townsend Deprivation Index, a composite measure of socioeconomic disadvantage, showed mediation through 155 proteins. This extensive molecular connectivity suggests that socioeconomic factors influence dementia risk through multiple biological systems rather than isolated pathways. Environmental pollution, particularly nitrogen dioxide exposure, was linked to dementia through up to 103 proteins, highlighting the neurological consequences of air quality. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol abstinence showed associations through 59 proteins, indicating complex relationships between behavioral choices and cognitive health.

Sex-stratified analysis of environmental pathways revealed nuanced patterns of protein mediation. While alcohol abstinence affected dementia risk through 58 proteins in the full cohort, only CHI3L1 showed female-specific mediation. Employment status, despite its broad influence through 155 proteins overall, showed male-specific mediation through GDF15, HPGDS, and NEFL. The Townsend Deprivation Index presented a particularly complex pattern, with female-specific mediation through GDF15 and PLAUR, and male-specific mediation through ANGPTL4, AREG, GAST, GDF15, and HPGDS. Notably, GDF15 emerged as the only protein showing significant mediation of Townsend Deprivation Index effects across all three analytical strata (combined, male, and female cohorts), establishing it as a robust molecular link between socioeconomic disadvantage and dementia risk regardless of sex.

### Genotype-to-Protein-to-Dementia Pathways

Genetic analysis identified twelve independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence dementia risk through the mediation of ten distinct proteins. Consistent with established genetic epidemiology, six of these variants mapped to the APOE locus, confirming the central role of apolipoprotein E in dementia pathogenesis. The mediation of these APOE variants through the APOE protein itself validates the direct functional consequences of genetic variation at this locus.

A particularly striking finding emerged from sex-stratified genetic analysis. The rs7412 variant, a key SNP defining the APOE ε2 allele, showed mediation of dementia risk through APOE protein exclusively in females, with no significant mediation observed in males. Conversely, rs157580 demonstrated APOE-mediated effects on dementia risk only in males. These sex-specific genetic pathways reveal that even well-established genetic risk factors may operate through different molecular mechanisms in males and females, suggesting that the penetrance and expressivity of genetic variants in dementia risk are modified by biological sex.

### Integrated Interpretation and Implications

The comprehensive analysis across all three pathway categories reveals a multilayered etiology of dementia characterized by convergent and divergent molecular mechanisms. Anthropometric measures, particularly those reflecting muscle function and body composition, influence dementia risk through remarkably broad protein repertoires enriched for metabolic and neuromuscular markers. This suggests that maintaining healthy body composition may protect against cognitive decline through multiple biological pathways simultaneously.

Environmental and socioeconomic exposures exert their effects predominantly through pleiotropic mediators, with GDF15 emerging as a central hub protein. The marked sex asymmetry in environmental pathway mediation indicates that males and females may respond differently to the same environmental stressors at the molecular level. Genetic predisposition, while channeled through a more focused set of proteins dominated by APOE, also demonstrates variant-specific and sex-specific effects that refine our understanding of genetic risk.

The biological insights from this analysis have several important implications. The strong representation of anthropometric proteins such as VGF and TNFRSF10B in linking body composition to neurodegeneration suggests that interventions targeting muscle-fat balance may offer preventive strategies for dementia. The pervasive sex-specific mediation patterns underscore the necessity of developing sex-tailored biomarker panels and intervention strategies rather than assuming universal molecular mechanisms. The repeated emergence of GDF15 across multiple pathway classes and both sexes nominates it as a high-priority target for translational research and therapeutic development. Finally, the detailed mapping of APOE variant-protein-disease chains demonstrates how ProteoNexus can pinpoint the causal proteins underlying GWAS loci, facilitating precision medicine approaches that consider both genetic background and biological sex.

This case study illustrates how ProteoNexus enables multilevel interrogation of complex diseases, from global pathway summaries to detailed sex-stratified mediation analyses. By integrating measurements, environmental exposures, and genetic variants through their protein mediators, the platform accelerates hypothesis generation and provides actionable insights for translational research in neurodegenerative diseases.
