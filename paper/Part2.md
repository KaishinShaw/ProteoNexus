## Case Study: Analysis of Dementia-Associated Protein Pathways Using ProteoNexus

To demonstrate the analytical capabilities and biological insights afforded by ProteoNexus, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of dementia, a complex neurodegenerative disorder with multifactorial etiology. This case study illustrates how the platform enables systematic exploration of protein-mediated pathways linking diverse risk factors to disease outcomes.

### Overview of Global Search Results

A global search for “dementia” in the ProteoNexus database identified 2,743 statistically significant pathway triplets, delineating an extensive molecular framework for the disease. These comprised 1,872 Measurement-to-Protein-to-Disease (M-P-D), 849 Environment-to-Protein-to-Disease (E-P-D), and 22 Genotype-to-Protein-to-Disease (G-P-D) associations and involved 285 distinct plasma proteins that acted as mediators linking diverse risk factors to dementia outcomes. 

Analysis of mediator frequency across all pathways highlighted several hub proteins that recur in dementia-associated networks, notably NEFL (frequency = 43), GDF15 (frequency = 35), BCAN (frequency = 32), HPGDS (frequency = 31), REN (frequency = 30), and FAP (frequency = 29). These proteins encompass functions ranging from metabolic regulation and inflammatory signaling to neuronal structural maintenance, underscoring the multisystem pathophysiology of dementia.

### Measurement-to-Protein-to-Dementia Pathways

Analysis of measurement-to-protein pathways revealed a pronounced predominance of anthropometric traits as risk factors for dementia. Of the 23 baseline measurements that exhibited significant protein-mediated associations with dementia, 21 were anthropometric, whereas psychosocial factors and other measurements each contributed a single trait, underscoring the central role of body composition and physical function in dementia susceptibility.

The strongest associations involved indices of muscle strength and adiposity. Hand-grip strength, assessed separately for the left and right hands, was linked to dementia through 139 and 119 proteins, respectively. Central adiposity markers showed similarly extensive mediation, with waist-to-hip ratio associated through 128 proteins and waist circumference through 3 proteins. Whole-body fat mass and trunk fat mass were connected to dementia via 125 and 116 proteins, respectively, and right-arm fat-free mass exhibited mediation through 117 proteins. These results indicate that the relationship between physical phenotype and cognitive decline is governed by a complex molecular network rather than by single pathways.

Sex-stratified analyses identified both shared and distinct mediation patterns. A core set of seven proteins, BCAN, EDA2R, GDF15, GFAP, NEFL, TNFRSF10B, and VGF, showed significant mediation in the full cohort as well as within each sex. Nevertheless, several pathways were sex specific. In males, the link between trunk fat percentage and dementia was mediated by VGF (indirect effect = −0.00414, SE = 0.00105, adjusted P = 0.028), whereas no corresponding effect was detected in females. Conversely, mediation of waist circumference by GDF15 (indirect effect = 0.72452, SE = 0.10286, adjusted P < 0.00001), BCAN (indirect effect = 0.30943, SE = 0.06328, adjusted P = 0.0003), and MENT (indirect effect = −0.44210, SE = 0.07340, adjusted P < 0.00001) was significant only in females and in the combined analysis, with no signals observed in males. These sex-specific differences suggest that the molecular mechanisms linking body composition to cognitive decline diverge between males and females, carrying important implications for individualized risk assessment and intervention.

### Environment-to-Protein-to-Dementia Pathways

Analysis of environment-to-protein pathways demonstrated that environmental and lifestyle exposures are extensively mediated at the molecular level in their associations with dementia, encompassing four principal categories. Healthy lifestyle factors contributed four traits, residential air pollution contributed three traits, and greenspace and coastal proximity and sociodemographic variables each contributed two traits. 

Sociodemographic factors exerted the broadest molecular influence; employment status was associated with dementia through 158 distinct protein mediators, whereas the Townsend Deprivation Index, a composite indicator of socioeconomic disadvantage, was mediated by 155 proteins, indicating that socioeconomic status modulates dementia risk through multiple biological systems rather than isolated pathways. Nitrogen dioxide exposure was linked to dementia through 103 proteins, highlighting the neurological impact of air quality. Among lifestyle factors, alcohol abstinence was associated with dementia through 59 proteins, reflecting complex interactions between behavior and cognitive health. 

Sex-stratified analyses revealed nuanced mediation patterns. In the full cohort, alcohol abstinence acted through 58 proteins, but in females only CHI3L1 mediated the association (indirect effect = −0.05087, SE = 0.01253, adjusted P = 0.02095). Employment status, despite its broad influence overall, showed male-specific mediation via GDF15 (indirect effect = −0.13785, SE = 0.03555, adjusted P = 0.02845), HPGDS (indirect effect = −0.11047, SE = 0.02733, adjusted P = 0.02148), and NEFL (indirect effect = −0.11506, SE = 0.02709, adjusted P = 0.01753). The Townsend Deprivation Index displayed female-specific mediation through GDF15 (indirect effect = 0.01493, SE = 0.00275, adjusted P = 0.00003) and PLAUR (indirect effect = 0.00913, SE = 0.00225, adjusted P = 0.01365), and male-specific mediation through ANGPTL4 (indirect effect = 0.00646, SE = 0.00177, adjusted P = 0.03331), AREG (indirect effect = 0.00816, SE = 0.00214, adjusted P = 0.02130), GAST (indirect effect = 0.00794, SE = 0.00200, adjusted P = 0.01502), GDF15 (indirect effect = 0.01159, SE = 0.00270, adjusted P = 0.00537), and HPGDS (indirect effect = 0.00849, SE = 0.00190, adjusted P = 0.00492). GDF15 was the only protein that significantly mediated the effect of the Townsend Deprivation Index in the combined cohort and in both sex-specific analyses, establishing it as a robust molecular link between socioeconomic disadvantage and dementia risk irrespective of sex.

### Genotype-to-Protein-to-Dementia Pathways

Analysis of genotype to protein pathways identified 12 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with dementia risk that are putatively mediated by 10 distinct proteins. Consistent with established genetic epidemiology, six of these variants map to the APOE genomic region, defined as the gene plus 1 Mb flanking sequences; the six cis-SNPs are rs7412, rs157580, rs157582, rs1160985, rs2075650, and rs8105340, confirming the central role of apolipoprotein E in dementia pathophysiology. The fact that these six APOE variants act as cis protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTLs) for apolipoprotein E provides strong evidence for a direct allelic effect on protein abundance at this critical locus. 

Interrogation of the pQTL analytics interface for APOE in sex-stratified datasets revealed pronounced sexual dimorphism in the downstream molecular architecture of dementia risk. The rs7412 missense allele that defines the ε2 isoform showed a significant indirect effect on dementia risk through circulating APOE protein levels in females and in the combined population (β = −0.0141, 95 % CI −0.0198 to −0.00835, Z = −4.81, P = 1.5 × 10^−6), whereas no mediation was detected in males. In contrast, the intronic variant rs157580 displayed a significant APOE-mediated pathway only in males (β = −0.0127, 95 % CI −0.0168 to −0.00869, Z = −6.18, P = 6.4 × 10^−10) with no corresponding effect in females. These observations indicate that even canonical APOE risk alleles exhibit sex-contingent penetrance, suggesting that hormonal milieu, sex-specific transcriptional regulation, or differential post-translational processing modulate their functional consequences. 

The pQTL results page provides interactive Manhattan and quantile versus quantile visualizations that contextualize the strength and genomic distribution of association signals; the quantile plot shows a marked upward deviation of the extreme tail from the null expectation, consistent with an excess of true associations, while the Manhattan plot depicts a dense cluster of genome-wide significant pQTLs on chromosome 19 centered on APOE, underscoring the presence of high-confidence causal variants in this region. 

Together, these findings delineate a concise yet mechanistically rich set of genotype to protein to disease pathways in which APOE functions as the principal proteomic conduit linking inherited variation to dementia risk. The sex specificity of key APOE alleles indicates that precision-medicine strategies for dementia must incorporate biological sex as a fundamental modifier of genetic effect sizes and protein-level mediators, thereby enabling more accurate risk stratification and the rational design of sex-tailored therapeutic interventions.

### Integrated Interpretation and Implications

The comprehensive analysis across all three pathway categories reveals a multilayered etiology of dementia characterized by convergent and divergent molecular mechanisms. Anthropometric measures, particularly those reflecting muscle function and body composition, influence dementia risk through remarkably broad protein repertoires enriched for metabolic and neuromuscular markers. This suggests that maintaining healthy body composition may protect against cognitive decline through multiple biological pathways simultaneously.

Environmental and socioeconomic exposures exert their effects predominantly through pleiotropic mediators, with GDF15 emerging as a central hub protein. The marked sex asymmetry in environmental pathway mediation indicates that males and females may respond differently to the same environmental stressors at the molecular level. Genetic predisposition, while channeled through a more focused set of proteins dominated by APOE, also demonstrates variant-specific and sex-specific effects that refine our understanding of genetic risk.

The biological insights from this analysis have several important implications. The strong representation of anthropometric proteins such as VGF and TNFRSF10B in linking body composition to neurodegeneration suggests that interventions targeting muscle-fat balance may offer preventive strategies for dementia. The pervasive sex-specific mediation patterns underscore the necessity of developing sex-tailored biomarker panels and intervention strategies rather than assuming universal molecular mechanisms. The repeated emergence of GDF15 across multiple pathway classes and both sexes nominates it as a high-priority target for translational research and therapeutic development. Finally, the detailed mapping of APOE variant-protein-disease chains demonstrates how ProteoNexus can pinpoint the causal proteins underlying GWAS loci, facilitating precision medicine approaches that consider both genetic background and biological sex.

This case study illustrates how ProteoNexus enables multilevel interrogation of complex diseases, from global pathway summaries to detailed sex-stratified mediation analyses. By integrating measurements, environmental exposures, and genetic variants through their protein mediators, the platform accelerates hypothesis generation and provides actionable insights for translational research in neurodegenerative diseases.

### Prediction Models for Personalized Dementia Risk Assessment

ProteoNexus also supports personalized dementia risk prediction through its Prediction Models interface, which accepts user-supplied proteomic profiles and returns quantitative risk estimates generated by optimized machine-learning algorithms. The platform displays Model Performance Visualization charts, including area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) comparisons and full ROC curves, to facilitate transparent assessment of predictive accuracy across algorithms and demographic strata. Systematic hyperparameter tuning improved performance in all groups. 

In the combined-sex cohort, an optimized LightGBM model (num_iterations = 280, num_leaves = 20, max_depth = 7, learning_rate = 0.014724, feature_fraction = 0.955837, bagging_fraction = 0.910568) achieved AUC = 0.873, up from 0.860 with the default configuration. Sex-stratified training revealed distinct optimal algorithms that reflect the dimorphic molecular signatures identified in pathway analyses. In females, an optimized XGBoost model (n_estimators = 128, max_depth = 3, learning_rate = 0.04115328656929196, subsample = 0.817289352370197, colsample_bytree = 0.8569426048372286, gamma = 0.9064417650719042) improved AUC from 0.798 to 0.837, whereas in males, an optimized LightGBM model (num_iterations = 296, num_leaves = 136, max_depth = 3, learning_rate = 0.027973784019777726, feature_fraction = 0.5638570827955587, bagging_fraction = 0.8834759303212951) increased AUC from 0.825 to 0.851. 

The interface automatically deploys the sex-appropriate model according to the user’s demographic input, ensuring that each prediction leverages the most accurate algorithm for the individual’s biological context.
