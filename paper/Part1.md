## Abstract

The human plasma proteome serves as a critical bridge between genetic variation, environmental exposures, and clinical phenotypes. Large-scale proteogenomic studies -- including recent profiling of \~50,000 individuals -- have uncovered tens of thousands of genetic associations with plasma protein levels and hundreds of thousands of protein-phenotype links [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857953/)]. These findings highlight the potential of plasma proteins in elucidating disease mechanisms [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10567546/)], identifying biomarkers, and discovering therapeutic targets. However, existing resources for plasma proteomics are limited in scope: some provide only summary association data [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857953/)], while others focus on either causal inference or outcome prediction in isolation.

Here, we present [ProteoNexus](https://www.proteonexus.com/), a comprehensive open-access database that integrates genetic architecture, mediation analyses, and predictive modeling of the human plasma proteome. ProteoNexus curates high-quality data from 33,325 UK Biobank participants (2,919 proteins) with 129 physiological traits, 54 environmental exposures, and 57 incident diseases, ensuring that protein measurements precede disease onset. Using genome-wide association with linear mixed models and fine-mapping, we identify \~64,000 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL), including 30,674 sex-specific signals. Mediation analysis across three pathway types -- physiology→protein→disease (M-P-D), environment→protein→disease (E-P-D), and genotype→protein→disease (G-P-D) -- reveals thousands of proteins with significant indirect effects. Notably, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) emerged as a significant mediator in G-P-D pathways (genetic variants influencing disease via APOE protein) but not in M-P-D or E-P-D, consistent with APOE's role as a genetic risk factor rather than an exposure-responsive biomarker [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1918094/)].

In parallel, we built and optimized machine-learning models (penalized regression, gradient boosting, neural networks) for each disease, achieving robust risk predictions (e.g. AUC up to 0.88 for type 2 diabetes) that often surpassed models using traditional clinical factors [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10684756/)]. ProteoNexus features an interactive web interface for querying exposures, proteins, and outcomes, visualization of pQTL and mediation results, and a "prediction server" where users can upload proteomic profiles to obtain personalized disease risk estimates. By integrating multi-faceted analyses of the plasma proteome, ProteoNexus provides a unique resource to advance our understanding of causal pathways and to facilitate precision medicine applications in complex diseases.

## Introduction

Plasma proteins play fundamental roles in human physiology and disease, acting as key messengers and effectors of biological processes. Their levels reflect both genetic determinants and environmental influences, making the plasma proteome a powerful window into disease etiology and a promising source of biomarkers and drug targets [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10567546/)]. Recent advances in high-throughput proteomics, combined with large biobank cohorts, have enabled systematic identification of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and protein-phenotype associations at unprecedented scale [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857953/)].

For example, genome-wide analyses in \~35,000 Icelanders (using 4,907 aptamers) uncovered \>18,000 variant-protein associations and \~257,000 protein-disease/trait links [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857953/)], while the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) assayed \~3,000 plasma proteins in \~50,000 participants, yielding comprehensive catalogs of both common and rare variant pQTLs [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10567546/)]. Notably, integrating rare coding variants via exome sequencing has revealed thousands of additional protein associations (over 5,400 rare variant pQTLs), the majority of which were missed by common-variant GWAS [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10567546/)]. These efforts underscore that the plasma proteome is under complex genetic control and can illuminate novel biology underlying complex traits.

Beyond mapping genetic associations, there is growing interest in leveraging proteomic data to infer causal relationships and to improve disease prediction. On one hand, proteins can mediate the effects of environmental or physiological risk factors on disease outcomes. Identifying such mediator proteins can pinpoint causal pathways and potential intervention targets. Several recent studies have applied causal inference (e.g. mediation analysis and Mendelian randomization) to specific diseases, revealing mediating proteins for traits like metabolic risk factors and cognitive decline [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10684756/)]. On the other hand, plasma protein profiles have shown promise in predicting future disease risk. A recent multi-disease analysis demonstrated that proteomic risk scores achieved equal or better predictive performance than traditional clinical indicators across dozens of endpoints [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10684756/)]. In that study, incorporating proteomic data significantly improved risk stratification for \~63% of tested diseases compared to demographic models, highlighting the added value of proteome-based prediction. Accordingly, the number of publications on plasma protein biomarkers and prediction has surged in recent years, reflecting a shift toward multi-dimensional risk modeling in epidemiology.

Despite these advances, researchers currently lack an integrated resource that combines genetic, epidemiological, and machine-learning perspectives on the plasma proteome. Existing databases and tools address parts of this spectrum. For example, deCODE genetics provides summary statistics for thousands of pQTLs and protein-disease associations [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857953/)], and the ARIC Proteome Project offers weights for proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) to link genes to complex traits [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10567546/)]. Other resources focus on either causal inference or prediction: Deng et al. established a proteome-phenome atlas with association and Mendelian randomization analyses, using a default LightGBM model for prediction, and You et al. built proteomic predictors for multiple diseases [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10684756/)]. However, no platform to date integrates all these components -- pQTL mapping, mediator identification, and optimized outcome prediction -- into a single, user-friendly framework. Furthermore, sex-specific effects, which are increasingly recognized in both genetics and biomarker profiles, have been underexplored in a systematic manner.

To fill these gaps, we developed ProteoNexus, a comprehensive platform that characterizes the genetic architecture of the plasma proteome, quantifies the mediating roles of proteins in causal pathways, and constructs predictive models for disease risk based on proteomic profiles. ProteoNexus capitalizes on individual-level data from the UK Biobank (UKB) with rigorous quality control to ensure proper temporal ordering (protein measurements preceding incident disease) and to minimize biases. The database is designed to assist a broad range of users -- from molecular biologists investigating disease mechanisms to epidemiologists and clinicians interested in risk prediction -- by providing intuitive query interfaces and rich visualization of results. Here we describe the data sources and analytical methods underlying ProteoNexus and highlight its unique features with example findings (including the differential role of APOE across pathway types). We also compare ProteoNexus with related resources and discuss its applications in advancing precision medicine.

## Materials and Methods

### Data collection and preprocessing

ProteoNexus leverages data from the UK Biobank, focusing on participants with high-quality proteomic and genomic data. We started with 48,894 individuals who had plasma protein measurements from the UKB-PPP Olink platform (Somalogic SomaScan measures of \~3,000 proteins) [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10684756/)]. To ensure a homogeneous population structure and reliable longitudinal follow-up, we applied stringent inclusion criteria: only unrelated participants of European ancestry were retained, excluding individuals with sex chromosome aneuploidy or gender mismatch, those lacking genetic data or principal components (PCs), and those with \>30% missing proteomic measurements. After quality control, 33,325 participants remained (17,988 female, 15,337 male), each with quantitative data for 2,919 plasma proteins.

Protein concentrations below detection or missing were rare (\<20% per protein for retained proteins); we removed 4 proteins with \>20% missingness and imputed remaining sporadic missing values by the cohort mean for that protein. All protein levels were log-transformed and standardized for analyses.

We curated 129 baseline measurement variables (exposures of type M) spanning anthropometrics (e.g. BMI, blood pressure), clinical lab assays (blood cell counts, lipid panel, liver enzymes, etc.), and other health indices, as well as 54 environmental variables (exposures of type E) covering air pollution metrics, green space access, socio-demographic factors, and lifestyle behaviors (diet, smoking, physical activity). For each exposure, we ensured that values were taken at or before the time of blood draw for proteomic assay to respect temporality.

Incident disease outcomes (type D) were defined based on hospital records and death registries using ICD-10 codes, adopting definitions from the FinnGen study with quality control filters [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857953/)]. We selected 57 incident diseases (14 cancers and 43 non-neoplastic diseases) that had at least 100 cases among our study population and whose first occurrence was recorded after the proteomic assessment. This design yields a median follow-up of \~15 years, enabling prospective analysis of disease incidence. All participants provided informed consent, and our use of the UKB data was under approved application 144904.

### Genetic association analysis (pQTL mapping)

We performed genome-wide association studies for each of the 2,919 proteins to characterize their genetic architecture. High-quality genotypes were imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. We excluded single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency (MAF) \< 1%, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P\<10\^-7, call rate \< 95%, or ambiguous mapping, following standard QC protocols. A total of \~8 million common SNPs passed filters.

We applied a linear mixed model using GEMMA (Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association) to test each SNP's association with protein levels, controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), array batch, and the top 18 genetic PCs (to account for population stratification). A genetic relationship matrix was used in GEMMA to further control for relatedness and cryptic structure. For each protein, associations with P_Wald \< 5×10\^-8 were considered genome-wide significant.

We then applied SuSiE (Sum of Single Effects) fine-mapping to each protein's locus-specific summary statistics to resolve independent signals and estimate the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) for each variant being causal. We defined high-confidence pQTL variants as those with PIP ≥ 0.85 within any credible set. ProteoNexus catalogs all significant pQTLs, annotated by variant ID, genomic position (GRCh37), effect allele and frequency, effect size (beta ± SE), P-value, and if applicable, the target gene (for cis-pQTL within ±500 kb of the encoding gene).

Overall, we identified 63,998 pQTL associations at genome-wide significance, of which roughly 81% correspond to cis-acting variants near the encoded gene. Notably, among these were 30,674 sex-specific pQTLs -- signals that reached significance in sex-stratified analyses (16,771 in females and 13,903 in males) but not in the combined-sex analysis -- underscoring sexual dimorphism in protein genetic regulation. As expected, our pQTL results recapitulate known findings from UKB-PPP [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10567546/)] and deCODE [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857953/)], and extend them by highlighting additional secondary signals through fine-mapping. All pQTL summary statistics are available for download, enabling further custom analyses by users.

### Mediation analysis of protein pathways

To investigate the causal role of proteins as mediators, ProteoNexus evaluates three types of pathways connecting exposures to disease outcomes via protein levels: (i) M-P-D (Measurement→Protein→Disease), (ii) E-P-D (Environment→Protein→Disease), and (iii) G-P-D (Genetic variant→Protein→Disease). We employed a two-step statistical approach for each pathway type.

First, we tested the total effect of the exposure on the disease outcome. For M-D and E-D pairs, we fitted age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models (incident disease \~ exposure) and identified those with a significant association at a false discovery rate q\<0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure). For G-D, we used GEMMA to perform SNP-level association with the disease (case-control status), considering genome-wide significance with Bonferroni correction (accounting for all variants tested) and likewise requiring q\<0.05. Only exposure-disease pairs with significant total effects (TE) were carried forward.

In the second step, we examined the indirect effect of the exposure on disease mediated by each protein. For M-P-D and E-P-D, this required that the exposure was significantly associated with the candidate mediator protein (M-P or E-P association q\<0.05 by linear regression controlling for covariates) and that the protein in turn showed differential levels in cases vs controls (implicitly tested as part of total effect modeling). For G-P-D, we similarly required that the variant significantly affected the protein (pQTL with Bonferroni-corrected P\<0.05 and PIP \> 0.8 for causality).

We then applied a mediation analysis using the medflex package in R, which estimates the indirect effect (IE) and direct effect in a counterfactual framework. Specifically, we built a mediator model (protein \~ exposure + covariates) and an outcome model (disease \~ exposure + protein + covariates) and computed the average causal mediation effect (ACME) via the δ-method for variance. Covariates (age, sex, BMI, and PCs) were included throughout to adjust for confounding. We considered a mediation pathway significant if the protein's IE passed q\<0.05 (BH-adjusted) for the given exposure-disease pair.

ProteoNexus identified an extensive network of significant mediated pathways. In total, among 309,841 tested M-P-D triples (measurement trait × protein × disease), 2,190 proteins showed significant mediation for at least one trait-disease combination (with 4,258 distinct M-P-D triplets reaching q\<0.05 for IE). Similarly, across 144,975 E-P-D pathways, 1,929 proteins mediated at least one exposure-disease link (2,987 significant triplets). Genetic mediation pathways were more targeted: out of 439 plausible G-P-D combinations (considering lead G-D associations and their pQTLs), 279 proteins (associated with 334 SNP-disease pairs) exhibited significant mediation effects, indicating that a substantial fraction of genetic risk for certain diseases is conveyed via protein abundance changes.

All significant mediation results are compiled in the database with effect size estimates and confidence intervals for both IE and direct effects, providing users with quantitative insight into how much of an exposure's impact on disease is channeled through a given protein. For functional context, ProteoNexus also performs enrichment analysis on the sets of proteins associated with each exposure (from the M-P and E-P steps). We used clusterProfiler to test Gene Ontology biological processes and KEGG pathways for over-representation among these protein sets. This helps highlight common pathways (e.g. inflammatory response, metabolic processes) linking groups of exposures to the proteome.

### Predictive model construction

An important feature of ProteoNexus is the development of predictive models for incident diseases using baseline proteomic profiles. We focused on the same 57 diseases and trained four types of classification models for each disease: (i) Penalized logistic regression (PLR) with L1/L2 regularization, (ii) Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), (iii) Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and (iv) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network.

To avoid overfitting and maximize generalizability, we randomly split the cohort into a training set (80%) and a hold-out test set (20%) stratified by disease status. Model hyperparameters were tuned via 5-fold cross-validation on the training set using a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) approach (implemented in the Hyperopt framework) to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space. The optimization objective was maximizing the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), rather than accuracy, due to class imbalance in many outcomes.

Each model had a tailored hyperparameter search space: for example, PLR was tuned over regularization strength and type (L1 vs L2) and solver algorithm, whereas XGBoost and LightGBM were tuned over number of trees, depth, learning rate, and subsampling fractions, among others. The final models selected were those with the highest cross-validated AUC. We evaluated performance on the test set, reporting metrics including AUC and, for reference, accuracy at the optimal threshold. To assess the incremental value of proteomics, we also compared these to baseline logistic models using only demographic risk factors (age, sex) and traditional clinical risk markers when available.

ProteoNexus provides these optimized prediction models for user exploration and application. For each disease, the web interface displays the ROC curve and AUC of all four models, including a benchmark "demographic model" and an "optimized proteomic model". On average, the proteomic models attained strong discriminative ability, with AUC \> 0.75 for 40 of the 57 diseases. XGBoost emerged as the single best-performing algorithm for the largest number of outcomes (winning in 30 diseases), followed by LightGBM (15 diseases) and MLP (7 diseases).

For example, in predicting type 2 diabetes, an XGBoost model achieved AUC = 0.884, substantially outperforming a model using age, sex, BMI, and family history [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10684756/)]. In acute renal failure, proteomic predictors reached AUC \~0.81, indicating good discriminative power. We also constructed sex-specific models for all diseases by training and tuning separately on female and male subsets. Interestingly, 32 of 49 non-sex-specific diseases saw improved AUC in one or both sex-specific models compared to the sex-combined model. For instance, the AUC for predicting kidney failure increased by 4% (from 0.78 to 0.81) when using a female-specific model and by 4% (from 0.77 to 0.80) with a male-specific model, reflecting sex differences in proteomic risk markers.

All trained models are available online, and a user-friendly Prediction module on the website allows researchers to upload their own plasma protein data (with the same 2,919 proteins) to obtain individualized disease risk predictions from our models. This can facilitate external validation and clinical translation of proteomic risk scores.

### Database implementation

ProteoNexus is implemented as a dynamic web application to ensure broad accessibility. The front-end interface is built using [Streamlit](https://www.proteonexus.com/) (a Python-based web framework), which renders interactive charts and tables directly in the browser. The back-end consists of precomputed result tables (pQTL outputs, mediation results, model coefficients, etc.), with queries handled via Python APIs. The site is deployed on a cloud server and is accessible via HTTPS without login.

Emphasis was placed on responsive visualization: users can quickly filter and sort tables, zoom into Manhattan plots of pQTL results, and download figures and data for offline analysis. The Search module allows keyword queries by gene (or protein name), exposure, or disease. For example, searching a gene name returns all analyses involving that protein -- such as pQTL associations (which datasets the protein has genetic hits in), mediation roles (which exposures/diseases it mediates), and whether it is a predictive marker for any outcome. Conversely, searching a disease lists its associated exposures and top predictive proteins. The Browse module organizes content by category: users can browse all exposures, all diseases, or analysis types (e.g. browse all significant M-P-D mediation results, or all pQTL hits).
