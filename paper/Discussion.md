In this study, we developed ProteoNexus, a comprehensive and interactive resource that integrates the genetic architecture, causal mediation pathways, and predictive capacity of the human plasma proteome. By leveraging deeply phenotyped data from over 33,000 UK Biobank participants, ProteoNexus provides a multi-faceted view of how proteins connect genetic predispositions and environmental factors to the incidence of 57 complex diseases. Our platform systematically maps pQTLs, including thousands of sex-specific signals, and applies rigorous mediation analysis to dissect G-P-D, M-P-D, and E-P-D pathways. Using dementia analysis results across different pathways as an example, the platform demonstrates detailed biostatistical insights. Furthermore, ProteoNexus delivers robust predictive models based on machine learning and deep learning approaches that often outperform conventional risk factors, offering a tangible step towards proteomically-informed precision medicine. The open-access web server, which allows users to query results and obtain personalized risk scores, is designed to empower a broad scientific community to explore these complex relationships.

A key strength of ProteoNexus lies in its integrative framework, which contrasts with existing resources that typically focus on a single analytical dimension, such as providing pQTL summary statistics or standalone predictive models. By harmonizing genetic association, causal inference, and risk prediction within a single platform built on prospectively collected data, ProteoNexus facilitates a more holistic understanding of disease etiology. The strict adherence to temporal causality strengthens the validity of our findings for both mediation and prediction. The extensive sex-stratified analyses throughout the database address a critical gap, revealing widespread sexual dimorphism in the genetic regulation of proteins and their role in disease, which has significant implications for developing sex-specific biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.

Our work, while comprehensive, has several limitations that warrant consideration. A primary constraint is the restriction of our cohort to individuals of European ancestry. The genetic architecture of protein levels and their downstream phenotypic consequences can differ substantially across populations due to variations in allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and gene-environment interactions. Consequently, the pQTLs, mediated pathways, and predictive models identified in ProteoNexus may not be directly generalizable to individuals of African, Asian, or other ancestries, potentially limiting the equitable application of our findings and overlooking ancestry-specific biological mechanisms. Another limitation is the scope of our genetic analysis. Although we performed sex-stratified analyses, which revealed important biological differences, our investigation did not extend to genetic variants on the sex chromosomes. The exclusion of X and Y-linked loci means our characterization of the genetic drivers of sexual dimorphism in the proteome is incomplete, as these chromosomes harbor genes with critical and distinct roles in male and female physiology.

Looking forward, the field of proteogenomics is poised for significant expansion, which will create opportunities to address these limitations and build upon the foundation established by ProteoNexus. The UK Biobank has announced a landmark project, initiated in January 2025, to measure approximately 5,400 proteins in samples from all 500,000 participants, including 100,000 longitudinal samples collected up to 15 years apart. The availability of this vastly larger and richer dataset will provide unprecedented statistical power to discover novel and rare pQTLs, refine mediation pathways, and enhance the accuracy of predictive models. Crucially, the inclusion of longitudinal proteomic data will enable the study of protein dynamics over time, offering insights into the trajectory of disease development and the aging process. Future iterations of ProteoNexus will aim to incorporate these expanded datasets, which will hopefully include more diverse populations to improve the trans-ethnic portability of our findings. Furthermore, subsequent analyses will be designed to include the sex chromosomes to provide a complete and unbiased assessment of the genetic factors contributing to sex differences in disease.

In conclusion, ProteoNexus represents a significant step forward in translating large-scale proteogenomic data into actionable biological knowledge and clinical tools. By providing an integrated, rigorously analyzed, and user-friendly platform, it serves as a powerful hypothesis-generation engine for researchers investigating disease mechanisms and a practical tool for those developing next-generation biomarkers and risk prediction algorithms. We anticipate that ProteoNexus will be a valuable resource for the scientific community, accelerating discoveries that bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype and ultimately advancing the goals of precision medicine.
